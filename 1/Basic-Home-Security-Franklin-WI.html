Per the most current stats, the average theft in the United States lasts for about 90 seconds to 12 minutes and, typically, a burglar will get into a home within one minute. 1 2 The majority of thefts target cash very first followed by electronic devices, jewels, and drugs. 3 Common security methods consist of never concealing extra secrets outside, never switching off all the lights, using small CCTV sticker labels on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours.</p>
