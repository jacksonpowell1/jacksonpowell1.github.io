<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal abuse.

By searching for the license plate varieties of parking area at the club and investigating the backgrounds of the lorries' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were wed. Imagine what somebody like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

When citizens are being watched by the authorities - or conscious they might be seen at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people might learn to be mindful about the books and periodicals they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the environments went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
