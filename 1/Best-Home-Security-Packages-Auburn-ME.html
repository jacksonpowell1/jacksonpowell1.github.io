In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
