<p>As you simply discovered, there are 2 broad categories of security cameras. What you generally discover at stores are consumer-grade cameras, which typically come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (United States $) for the set. The 2nd category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, generally begins at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a substantially higher price. The video recorder must be purchased separately, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (United States $) and can range as much as $5000 depending on the amount of storage, camera connection, and image processing features.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both animals and people. Considering that carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, the only way to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide detector. Thankfully, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your house increases to a dangerous level. With a wireless system, you can also get push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is a problem, even when you're not in the house.</p>
<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private guard. A number of cities likewise need a license to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
