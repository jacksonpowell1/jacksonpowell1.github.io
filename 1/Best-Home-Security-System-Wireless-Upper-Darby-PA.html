It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration).

<p>The Ring Stick Up Web cam can be found in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside and outdoors. However neither can record continuously, and they both need the Ring Secure plan to record recordings. Also, the wired variation generally left gaps of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also lack individual detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to cut down on incorrect signals.</p>
