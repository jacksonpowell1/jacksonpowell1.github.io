<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to police capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund authorities action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and costly approach to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
