We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it permits you to control practically every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's highly adjustable.

The camera can tape-record video in up to 1080p, which looks completely great on a mobile phone screen and will not tax your web connection too much.

The best security cameras also use a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to frighten intruders using your mobile phone. Some fully-monitored home security systems also alert your security provider's monitoring center of motion-triggered activity. And today's indoor security cameras deliver a lot more than tape-recorded video footage. Most feature the choice to view live action video, and cameras with two-way interaction let you sign in with kids after school, inform Rover to leave your favorite chair, or terrify the daytimes out of someone who does not belong in your home (plus you'll have their picture, to boot!).</p>
