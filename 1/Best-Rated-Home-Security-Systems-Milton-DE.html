The latter enables you to see precisely when a specific individual arrives at your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).
