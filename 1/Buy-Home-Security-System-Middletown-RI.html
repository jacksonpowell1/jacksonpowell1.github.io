Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked just about half of the camera and the time consistently disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, as well as when we made modifications in the settings.</p>

<p>Many modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems integrate DVRs (digital video recorders) which enable operators to gain some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup.
