<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
