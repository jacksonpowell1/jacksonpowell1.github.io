<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole household will like. ADT is a household name, so we frequently try out their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of screening, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason.

That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with clever wise home features. We especially liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by.
