<h3>New House Alarm System Grass Valley CA 95945</h3>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
