<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and an extraordinary worth. It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
