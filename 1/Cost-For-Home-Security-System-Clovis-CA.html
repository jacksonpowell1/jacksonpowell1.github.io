Functions 1080p HD camera with night vision. One thing we really liked was the customer-friendly policies-- like the life time guarantee on products and the rate-lock assurance for life. This shows us that the company actually appreciates its users. Besides maybe Frontpoint or ADT, we generally don't see this with most companies.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
