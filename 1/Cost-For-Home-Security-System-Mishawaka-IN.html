<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage alternative and others don't. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; nevertheless, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage generally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself. This option is normally cost-free.

However, this is normally a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend upon how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
