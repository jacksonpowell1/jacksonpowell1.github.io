When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, once again based upon whether the design is typically open or typically closed.

<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize authorities response to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  method to break-in decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
