<p>To assess response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a private security guard. A number of cities also need a permit to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
