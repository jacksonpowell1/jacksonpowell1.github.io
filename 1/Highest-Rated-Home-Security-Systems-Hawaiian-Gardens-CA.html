<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by.
