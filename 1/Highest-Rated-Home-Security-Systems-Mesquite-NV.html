Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond.
