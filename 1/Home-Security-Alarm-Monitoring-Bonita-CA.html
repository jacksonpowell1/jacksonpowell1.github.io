In this case the alarm company owns the main equipment such as control board, keypad, motion sensor. Anything added additional you would own but if you do not restore their high priced strategy they'll eliminate their" equipment leaving you with no working alarm. Simply another sneaky technique to retain extremely rewarding accounts.</p>
