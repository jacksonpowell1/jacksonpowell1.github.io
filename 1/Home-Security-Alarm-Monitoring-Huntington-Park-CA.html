<p>Smart Sensors - Noise an alarm whenever safeguarded windows and doors are opened and can also be utilized to secure medication cabinets, gun cabinets, or the door to a child's bedroom. Night vision: A lot of burglaries occur after dark, so this feature is almost as essential as motion detection.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems using growth and totally free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to manually eliminate to transfer the information? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
