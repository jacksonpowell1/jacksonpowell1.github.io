<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative clever home fanatics or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is costly, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Analog high definition cameras are a terrific alternative for services to update from analog CCTV that has already been wired using coax cable television or CAT-5 cable television.

While professional monitoring costs more, it's more secure. When something triggers your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and then alert the authorities for you. Looks like a safer bet to us.</p>
