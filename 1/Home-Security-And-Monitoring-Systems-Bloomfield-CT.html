<p>After buying, installing, and using these systems for 8 months, we found 4 standout companies.

<p>ADT puts your privacy first, and we do not sell your personal information. Blue by ADT products use login failure lockout and password strength reinforcement, as well as encryption innovation. With 6.2 million customers, ADT is the most relied on name in home security.
