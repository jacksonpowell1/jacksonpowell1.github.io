<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
