Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>
