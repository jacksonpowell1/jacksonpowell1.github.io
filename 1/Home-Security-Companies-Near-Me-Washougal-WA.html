<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom.

<p>One of the very best elements of this alarm system is that it has a very innovative motion sensor.

Additionally, the motion sensor here is even more advanced than the ones supplied by adobe Starter Set.
