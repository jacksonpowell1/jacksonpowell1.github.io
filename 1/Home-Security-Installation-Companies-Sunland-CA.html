Just a couple decades back, the home security market was dominated by a few huge names offering expensive, stiff strategies with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensing units connected to a keypad control panel and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has all altered.</p>
