<p>An outdoor camera is perfect for keeping an eye on what's happening beyond your home. These gadgets are weatherproof and usually require a nearby GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlet to supply power, although there are a handful of battery-powered designs out there. As with their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras link to your Wi-Fi network and allow you to view live video from your phone.

<p>Really just, the individual at the door presses the button. You'll get an alert to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you want a doorbell noise too.)

Helpful if, for example, it's the postman and you're out. You can advise him or her where to leave the products.</p>

The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.
