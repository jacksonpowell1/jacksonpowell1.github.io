The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to fix information after the reality, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of recording storage space.
