You may even provide directions on how to get into your structure. As just recently as 10 years earlier, consumers did not have access to technology that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems changed that.

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced smart home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
