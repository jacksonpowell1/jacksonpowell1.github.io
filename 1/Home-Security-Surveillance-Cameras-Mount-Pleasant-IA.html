<p>While every property owner stresses over burglaries, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically resulting in incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a free smart device app that allows people who see something suspicious to take an image and rapidly send it to public safety authorities. For instance, a public transit rider may notice someone acting suspiciously. Many people are fiddling, texting or surfing with their mobile phones.

Reports from smart phone users can be quickly evaluated and acted upon by Public Safety authorities.</p>

However that does not mean you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to utilize your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
