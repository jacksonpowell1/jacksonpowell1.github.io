<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide simple DIY installation, other companies offer (and often need) expert installation. Professional installation is readily available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
