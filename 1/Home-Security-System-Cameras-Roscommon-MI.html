<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server run by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the standard nowadays, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard disk drive.

<p>Another essential subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
