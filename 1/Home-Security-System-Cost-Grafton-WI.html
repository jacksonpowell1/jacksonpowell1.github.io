<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
