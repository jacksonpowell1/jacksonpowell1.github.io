Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to store and for how long you prepare to keep documented footage. The footage is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
