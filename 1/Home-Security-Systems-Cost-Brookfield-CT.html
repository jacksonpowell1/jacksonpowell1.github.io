<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a declaration saying the system would alert users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of circumstances for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the existing system.</p>
