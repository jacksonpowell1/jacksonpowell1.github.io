<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
