The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature.
