<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
