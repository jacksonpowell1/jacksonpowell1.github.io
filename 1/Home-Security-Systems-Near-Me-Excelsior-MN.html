<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were typically missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
