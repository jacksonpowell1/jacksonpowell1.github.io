<p>There's no devoted hub included here - each camera connects straight to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a cool service, or at least one that saves a power socket and an Ethernet port, but we can't help however feel it's likewise the factor for the Swann's a little sluggish response times. Many new security companies are created for DIY installation only. ADT remains old-fashioned by setting up each security system themselves.
