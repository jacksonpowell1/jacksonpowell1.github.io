We have actually discovered good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brands readily available. Sometimes you do not have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use only expert installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list offer you a Do It Yourself option. ADT does not have the strongest customer care credibility among the companies we considered, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked the majority of this as much as the fact that ADT has several million more consumers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
