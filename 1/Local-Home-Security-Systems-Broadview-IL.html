<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
