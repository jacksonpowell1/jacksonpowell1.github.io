<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors guard your security system versus short-term rises that can get in through Air Conditioning power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. Home automation is easy and practical, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier.

Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year contract, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the better offer for you. Go with the agreement and reap those cost savings if you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years. However if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
