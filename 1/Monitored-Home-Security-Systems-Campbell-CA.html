In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
