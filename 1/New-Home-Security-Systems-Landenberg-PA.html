Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to keep and the length of time you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage space rapidly.
