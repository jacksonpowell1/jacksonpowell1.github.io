If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again react to the alarm; each response is billed.

For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly switch off the heater. If the motion sensing units are activated, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away possible robbers.</p>
