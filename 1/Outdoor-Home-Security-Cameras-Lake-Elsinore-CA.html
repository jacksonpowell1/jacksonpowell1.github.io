<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
