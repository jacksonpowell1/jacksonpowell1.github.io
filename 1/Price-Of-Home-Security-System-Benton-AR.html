<p>I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have actually tested scores of smart-home gadgets, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. As a former editor for Electronic House and Broad View Big Noise, I've composed buying guides for multiple consumer-electronics items, and I've composed short articles covering innovation for The New York Times (which is now Wirecutter's moms and dad company), Wired, Woman's Day, Guy's Health, and other publications.</p>
<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send out signals, make sure it deals with other smart devices. Lots of recent outdoor Wi-Fi cameras provide assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That), an internet service that uses tiny programs (applets) that you produce to have the camera interact with other IFTTT-enabled devices. For instance, you can have a wise plug turn on a lamp inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera spots motion.</p>
