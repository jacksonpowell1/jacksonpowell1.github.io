Unfortunately I acquired 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is really excellent. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
