<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government agents tends to deter things.
