IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and offers power to it.

IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
