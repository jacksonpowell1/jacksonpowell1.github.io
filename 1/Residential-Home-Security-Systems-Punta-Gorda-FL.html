<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes use just to NVR systems, but they eliminated other elements that would be essential for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cables used to link cameras to the DVR.

For all the benefits of Nest Secure, the quality of client service is not one of them. In fact, unsatisfied customers usually have an issue getting across proficient professionals when they have technical issues.</p>
