<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras lower crime. HD CCTV systems are compatible with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TV that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that implies you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system. That's just $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the Residence Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensing unit, and a remote key fob. That also includes free mobile access and 3 days of video storage.</p>
<p>While not an important requirement for a home security system, all top companies provide a variety of camera options as add-ons.

All of these cameras can be incorporated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere.
