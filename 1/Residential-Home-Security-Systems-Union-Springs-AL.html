<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to secure the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating system at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he might look at the whole location and speak to me about my concerns. He was expert, very reassuring and courteous. The second guard got here in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the morning to get the event started, he was also professional, polite and comforting. We were extremely delighted with your service and I will advise that we contact your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. When after leaving our property in your hands, I didn't worry.</p>
