<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, centers, and others. Some individuals might state that we should not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They claim that they attack personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you want personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are meant to keep you and other home safe, not to stalk you.

Simply a couple years back, the home security industry was controlled by a couple of big names using costly, rigid strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
