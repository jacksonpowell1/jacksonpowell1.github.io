You can even combine several cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But given that most retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some extra cash while offering a client change, for instance), we think it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you need.

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements!
