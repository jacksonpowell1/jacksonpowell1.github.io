<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was created for house owners. It should be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, once installed, is hard to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for big properties and are often more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your home.
