<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
