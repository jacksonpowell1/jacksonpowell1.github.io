<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen frequently enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
