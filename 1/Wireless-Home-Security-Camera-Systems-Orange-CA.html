<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
