<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
