<p>Thanks to recent advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you have actually made the decision to install an alarm system, you need to think about the following advantages of wireless innovation. The $260 Essentials package consists of the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensing unit, a lawn indication, and two window decals. For $15 per month, you can include around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control via iOS and Android smart device apps, push and email alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is readily available individually. Without the $25 plan, you handle all controls via the keypad.</p>
