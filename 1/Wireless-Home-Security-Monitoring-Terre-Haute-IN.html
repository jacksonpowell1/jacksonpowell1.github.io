<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
