<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the maker, rather of at your house) is the standard nowadays, but some cameras save recordings in your area on a microSD card or a connected hard disk. Onboard storage is good, but it won't be of much assistance if someone takes the camera. Hackers can get control of wireless camera systems.
