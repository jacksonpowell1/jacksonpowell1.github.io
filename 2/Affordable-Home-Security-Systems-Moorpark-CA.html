<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi info. (You need to play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, dogs shout, felines squeal, children cry.
