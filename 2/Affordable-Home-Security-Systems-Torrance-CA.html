With the capability to focus and out without surrendering its focus.

Tim in Tech Support has been extremely useful when we needed to include new cameras or repair issues. He is very patient with those people that don't have expertise in the IP world.

Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You must play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs wail, cats scream, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
