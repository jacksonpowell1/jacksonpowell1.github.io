Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
