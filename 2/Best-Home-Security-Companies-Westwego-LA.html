You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, druggies or members."
