We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard clever home gadgets like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and examine that you locked your doors.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
