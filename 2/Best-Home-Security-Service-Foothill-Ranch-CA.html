<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it spotted any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a declaration saying the system would signal users.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the issue.
