While the cameras get most of the attention in the beginning, you also have other issues, such as watching, recording, and archiving the video footage, and the equipment needed for carrying out those jobs. Here's a look at the basic elements of a common CCTV system. We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. We began with 16 cameras & have grown to 25 cameras. Tim in Tech Support has actually been extremely useful when we required to include new cameras or troubleshoot issues.
