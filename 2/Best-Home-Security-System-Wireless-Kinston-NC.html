<p>Discover how to develop, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we may revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of video to the cloud.
