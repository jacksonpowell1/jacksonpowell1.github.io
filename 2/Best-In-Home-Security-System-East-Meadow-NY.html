<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>

Although the cameras examined in this guide do have basic security features, they can't replace a complete home security system, that includes windows and door and motion sensing units, smoke alarm, and so on.</p>
