For an extra layer of security, search for a camera with sound detection that can let you know if somebody is out there even if they run out range of the camera lens and the motion sensing unit. Fair warning: You'll probably have to fine-tune the sound level of sensitivity settings to avoid alerts from barking dogs, loud automobiles, and other random sounds.</p>
