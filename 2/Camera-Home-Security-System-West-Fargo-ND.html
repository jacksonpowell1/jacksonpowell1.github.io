Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
