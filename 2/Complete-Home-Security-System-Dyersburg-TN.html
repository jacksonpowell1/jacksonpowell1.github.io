Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
