'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody!

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
