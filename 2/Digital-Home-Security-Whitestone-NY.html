<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
