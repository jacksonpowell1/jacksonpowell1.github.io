Now, many security systems involve a variety of elements, such as a base station, security camera, entry, glass, and motion break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few elements.

<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and portability. Renters, unlike homeowners, typically prevent making irreversible changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other components can easily be set up at different properties in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
