In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop.
