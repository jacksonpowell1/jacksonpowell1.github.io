<p>The real factor cameras are usually deployed is to decrease much pettier criminal activities. However it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have discovered that they have actually not lowered crime. "When the crime and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward trend in offences and crimes," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in specific classifications however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre."
