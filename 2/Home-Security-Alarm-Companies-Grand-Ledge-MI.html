<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop.
