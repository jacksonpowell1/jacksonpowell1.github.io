Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>The 720p camera offers a 172-degree view and color night vision. You can store the videos on the base unit rather of the cloud.
