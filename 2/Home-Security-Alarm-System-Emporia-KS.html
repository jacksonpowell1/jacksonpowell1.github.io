<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we might review this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud.
