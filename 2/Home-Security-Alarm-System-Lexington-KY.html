<h3>Best Security Home System in Lexington KY</h3>
<p>There have long been reputable guidelines governing the audio recording of people without their approval (there is a reason surveillance cameras never ever have microphones). It makes no sense that we do not have equivalent laws for video recording. Wireless security systems use radio frequency (RF) or sometimes Wi-Fi connections to connect security sensing units to the general system. Z-Wave and Zigbee are some of the more common wireless technologies used by significant security companies. Here are a couple of things wireless systems offer over conventional hardwired systems.</p>
<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. It triggers the doorbell camera when someone rings the doorbell. That video can go to your mobile phone, computer, or to a screen inside your home. Doorbell cameras become part of lots of home automated systems and provide an additional layer of protection.

The primary difference is that the wired system couple with the other smart home devices to create a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (also referred to as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other smart gadgets and can not be controlled from another location. Likewise a local alarm will not call the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to notify people close by.</p>
