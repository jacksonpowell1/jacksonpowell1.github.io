<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disruption principle based on two unshielded (or 'leaking') coaxial cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter releases continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the change in field strength weakens due to the existence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
