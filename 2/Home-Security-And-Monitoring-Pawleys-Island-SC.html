Expert video surveillance cameras, whether analog or digital, offer ruggedized outdoor enclosures or housings particularly developed to safeguard the camera from the elements and the imagery created by those cameras. These housings consist of heating units, not only to keep the equipment warm in subzero temperature levels, but also to avoid the dome or window from fogging up in cool and damp weather.</p>
<p>After purchasing, installing, and utilizing these systems for eight months, we found four standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all supply an impressive consumer experience and intuitive, innovative security tech. We 'd be comfortable outfitting our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a particular area.
