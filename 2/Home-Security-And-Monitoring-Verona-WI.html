<h3>The Best Home Security System in Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Because it's more complex than it must be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
