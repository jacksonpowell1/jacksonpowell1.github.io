And although the app and software application are easy to deal with, it's a bit of a disappointment that you can't integrate this camera with any clever home hubs or devices. A lot of clever cameras can be set to do things like this, however couple of make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
<p>PRESSURE CODES - An unknown function that is offered on professionally monitored alarm systems is the capability to establish a pressure code that will deactivate the alarm but likewise silently send a panic alarm to the monitoring service if you are in need of help.

Features 1080p HD camera with night vision. One thing we actually liked was the customer-friendly policies-- like the life time guarantee on items and the rate-lock guarantee for life. This reveals us that the company actually cares about its users. Aside from perhaps Frontpoint or ADT, we typically don't see this with most companies.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
