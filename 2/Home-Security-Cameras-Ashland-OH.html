<p>While every property owner frets about burglaries, suspicion has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a totally free smart device app that allows people who see something suspicious to take an image and rapidly send it to public safety authorities. For example, a public transit rider might notice somebody acting suspiciously. Many individuals are fiddling, texting or surfing with their mobile phones. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap an image of the suspicious activity and send it to security officials with a few clicks.

If  cops are contacted for an incorrect alarm, property owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching police needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the capacity for subsequent penalties and incorrect alarms.</p>
