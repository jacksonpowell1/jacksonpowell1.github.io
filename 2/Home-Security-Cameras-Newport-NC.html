Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by.
