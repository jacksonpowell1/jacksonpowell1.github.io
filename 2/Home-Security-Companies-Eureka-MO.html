<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly shut off the heater. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can automatically make the wise lights turn on to scare away prospective burglars.</p>
<p>Depending upon the zone triggered, number and sequence of zones, time of day, and other aspects, the alarm monitoring center may immediately initiate different actions. Central station operators may be instructed to call emergency situation services immediately, or to initially call the secured premises or residential or commercial property manager to attempt to figure out if the alarm is genuine. Operators could likewise start calling a list of phone numbers offered by the client to call someone to go check on the protected facilities. Some zones may activate a call to the local heating oil company to go examine the system, or a call to the owner with information of which space may be getting flooded. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that present video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to point out tape-recorded.</p>

Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even use the type of cameras they are selling to the public, and there is a good reason that.</p>
