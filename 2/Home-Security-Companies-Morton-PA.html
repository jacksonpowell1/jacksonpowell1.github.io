CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that chances to anger can be lowered by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and decreasing provocations that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
