<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the reality, which suggests that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and take up a lot of taping storage space. So much, in truth, that they need about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to record the same length of video footage.
