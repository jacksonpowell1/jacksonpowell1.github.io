As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense. As soon as a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.
