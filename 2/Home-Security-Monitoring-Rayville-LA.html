As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense.
