Now, a lot of security systems include a multitude of components, such as a base station, security camera, entry, glass, and motion break sensing units, a keypad, and crucial fobs, to name a few parts. However I also value minimalist systems that components that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, clever lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
