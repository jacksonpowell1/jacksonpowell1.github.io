<p>The real reason cameras are generally released is to decrease much pettier crimes. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively released in public places, sociologists studying the concern have actually found that they have not lowered criminal offense. "Once the criminal activity and offence figures were adapted to take account of the general down trend in offences and criminal activities," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British government).</p>
