For longer access to video, expect to pay a regular monthly storage cost.</p>

<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, starting with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its double articulating LED floodlights cover an extremely large area, and you can dim them through its app if you desire state of mind lighting on your deck or patio for a celebration. Furthermore they can not send fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video.

If you do buy them, initially check the suppliers return policy and second keep the invoice.</p>

On the downside, installation is requiring, and you'll need to drill a lot of holes to accommodate all the circuitry. This might not be practical if you're renting.
