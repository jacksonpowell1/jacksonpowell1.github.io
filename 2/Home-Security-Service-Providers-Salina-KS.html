The cameras invested weeks protecting our front door, alerting us to pals, relative, shipment people, and even the milkman. As soon as we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we tilted the whole collection outward for another two weeks to see what sort of outcomes we would get when the cameras faced your home throughout the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>
<p>Setting aside the really obvious benefit of protecting your home, here are 5 reasons to buy a wireless security camera if you're still caught on the fence.

Considering that they're so undoubtedly identifiable as a security camera, they're an excellent deterrent as well, and they're simple to install just about anywhere.
