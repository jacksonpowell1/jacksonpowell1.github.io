<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
