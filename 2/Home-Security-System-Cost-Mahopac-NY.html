<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras reduce crime. HD CCTV systems are compatible with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities if you buy HD-CCTV security system.

<p>During the night, though it lacks the full IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to select moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Just a couple years ago, the home security market was controlled by a few huge names offering expensive, stiff plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-term contracts.

I put this wireless CCTV camera type top of the list merely because if you do not understand it, you will lose big. Smart technology knows the difference.

<p>Focus on the existing lighting in the locations where you want to install security cameras. Try to find the night vision variety of each camera and think about how much location you wish to cover. And beware of using an indoor camera to look outside; they can't generally capture images through a window or after dark.
