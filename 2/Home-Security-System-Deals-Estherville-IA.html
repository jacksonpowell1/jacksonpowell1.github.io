<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
