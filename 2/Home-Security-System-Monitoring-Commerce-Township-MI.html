However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have additional sensors and crucial fobs, too.</p>
