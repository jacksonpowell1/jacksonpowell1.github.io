<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm in Tennessee</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
