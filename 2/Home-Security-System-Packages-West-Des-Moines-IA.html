<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to save and how long you prepare to keep documented video. The video footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
