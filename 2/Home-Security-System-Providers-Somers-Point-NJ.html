<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
