The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
