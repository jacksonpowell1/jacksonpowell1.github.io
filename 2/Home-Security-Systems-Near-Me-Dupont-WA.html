<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we evaluated, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?
