Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
