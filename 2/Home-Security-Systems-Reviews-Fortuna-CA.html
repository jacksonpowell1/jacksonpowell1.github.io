Renters, unlike house owners, typically avoid making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other elements can easily be established at different homes later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies also allow push-button control of the system and general home automation.

For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a light inside or activate an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
