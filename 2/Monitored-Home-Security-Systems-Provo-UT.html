<p>The very first wireless function to think about is the security system and its parts, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every door and window required its own wire and course of holes through your house. Wireless systems utilize radio frequencies that are just reliable up to a certain radius.
