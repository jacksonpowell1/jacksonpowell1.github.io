Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR.

Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and when the lighting becomes low or absent (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
