<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a normal camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the fact, which indicates that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it likewise brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage space. So much, in fact, that they require about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
