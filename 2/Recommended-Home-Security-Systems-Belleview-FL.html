<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
