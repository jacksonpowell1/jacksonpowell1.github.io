<p>Reliability is a highly subjective when it comes to innovation matter, depending upon which features and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, however low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common problems. Hardwired systems need very little upkeep, and short of a basic power blackout, are more difficult to interrupt. Regardless of a basic improvement in wireless technology, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and disabled.</p>
<p>The cost of a home security system varies by provider. Some suppliers permit you to choose from predetermined equipment packages while others work with you to construct a customized security system. Some security systems do not require any equipment payment upfront, while others might cost up to $1,300.00 to start.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
