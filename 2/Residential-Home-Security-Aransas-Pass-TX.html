They link to the company's respective app, so you're always in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensing units cost just $44.99 and use three to 5 times more variety than ADT's and Vivint's.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
