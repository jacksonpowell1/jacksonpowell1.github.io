<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
