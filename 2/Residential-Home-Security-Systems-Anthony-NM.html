<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
