<h3>Residential Security Alarm Systems Austin IN 47102</h3>
<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or mindful they might be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Indeed, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings underwent prolonged surveillance.</p>
