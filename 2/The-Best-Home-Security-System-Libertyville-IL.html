<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.

Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
