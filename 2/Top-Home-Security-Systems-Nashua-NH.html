Due to the fact that whatever is simply stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, getting rid of cameras, detectors, and other components of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new location takes minutes, not days.

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
