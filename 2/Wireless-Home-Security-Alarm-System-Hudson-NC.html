<p>Thanks to current improvements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install an alarm system, you need to consider the following advantages of wireless technology. eBay makes it easy to search by price, condition, the number of cameras consisted of and more. We have actually discovered great deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brands offered. Sometimes you don't have a choice.

<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen frequently enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm but you're in a meeting with a vendor and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service means you don't get alerted until the next day?
