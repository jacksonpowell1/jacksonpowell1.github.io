Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
