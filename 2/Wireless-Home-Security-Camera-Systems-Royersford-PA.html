<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is discovered.
