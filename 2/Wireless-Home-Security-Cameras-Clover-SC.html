Still, if technology has made us susceptible, then it can also make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pushing difficult to innovate in the linked home CCTV camera space.

It ships with four white and streamlined bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor use. They're equipped with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and wise IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app occasionally forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
