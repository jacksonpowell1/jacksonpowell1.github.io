<p>Nest Secure offers loads of clever gadgetry-- so much so that you may get overwhelmed by all of the options. But hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd anticipate absolutely nothing less! We really delighted in using Nest Secure for home protection and automation, however keep in mind that it can get expensive if you don't currently have a Nest wise home ecosystem installed.

Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to by hand remove to move the data? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
