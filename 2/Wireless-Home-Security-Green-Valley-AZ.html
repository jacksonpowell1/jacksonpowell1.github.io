<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and decrease criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we may review this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer.
