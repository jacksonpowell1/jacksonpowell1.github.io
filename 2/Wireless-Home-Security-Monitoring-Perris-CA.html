<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

<p>However at the very same time, you may get lost in the endless kinds of CCTV camera.
