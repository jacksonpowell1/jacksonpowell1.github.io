Its wireless installation provides you a lot of flexibility.

You can even combine multiple cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But given that many retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyway (a worker slipping some extra cash while providing a customer change, for example), we think it's more important to have high-quality images so you have the proof you require.

Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
